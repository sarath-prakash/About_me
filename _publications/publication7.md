title: Influence of free stream disturbance on hypersonic boundary layer dynamics over a cone–cylinder–flare
year: 2025
excerpt: Hypersonic transition studies on systems sustaining multimodal dynamics are critical to understanding aerothermal loading on flight-relevant configurations. The present work evaluates transition mechanisms in hypersonic boundary layers over a cone–cylinder–flare geometry, and its sensitivity to free stream disturbance amplitudes, using a global linear stability approach and direct numerical simulations (DNS). Under relatively quiet conditions, the flow field resembles the laminar solution, consisting of a large separation zone over the cylinder–flare junction. Linear analysis identifies multiple convective instabilities including, oblique first modes and two-dimensional second modes over the cone segment, and shear layer instabilities over the separation zone.

title: Studies on the melting dynamics of PCM in a semicircular cavity with straight and wavy heating surfaces
year: 2024
excerpt: Semi-circular enclosures have an inherent advantage of decreasing unmelt volume on top with an increase in melt height when heated from bottom. Hence the melt dynamics differs from conventional rectangular enclosures of similar orientation and realizes faster thermal response during the entire regimes of melting. Experimental and numerical studies on Rayleigh Benard convection in a semi-circular enclosure having straight, corrugated, and wavy bottom surface with constant heat flux conditions are presented. Melt front evolution, thermal convection, and unsteady surface heat transfer characteristics of a phase changing material contained in a semicircular confinement are presented in this study. Enthalpy-porosity method based finite volume solver is used to simulate the unsteady thermal convection of PCM in semi-circular enclosure. Experimental thermal response at various locations inside the confinement and shadowgraph images are used to verify the numerical results quantitatively and qualitatively.

title: Performance analysis of phase changing material embedded latent heat storage system (Collaboration)
layout: project
year: 2022-2023
excerpt: The melting characteristics of phase change materials (PCMs) under different heat transfer fluid passage configurations were investigated using both experimental and computational methods. Experimentally, a thermocouple was used to measure the temperature of the PCM, and shadowgraphy was used to visualize the flow of the heat transfer fluid. Computationally, the Ansys-Fluent software was used to simulate the melting process, and the Tecplot software was used to post-process the data. Further, MATLAB was used to analyze both the image and numerical data.

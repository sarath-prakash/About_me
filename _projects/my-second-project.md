title: Impact of surface texture elements on turbulent boundary layer drag characteristics (Post-doctoral work)
layout: project
year: 2023-present
excerpt: High-fidelity simulations are used to evaluate the efficacy of surface texture elements in reducing the turbulent skin-friction drag over a flat-plate configuration. The study solves the compressible Navier–Stokes equations with an artificial compressibility formulation to model incompressible flow, with surface texture elements implemented using an immersed boundary method.

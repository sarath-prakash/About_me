title: Wake Dynamics in a Variable Velocity Inflows (Thesis work)
layout: project
year: 2018-2023
excerpt: The three-dimensional transition mechanism of the vortical flow features developed from transitional boundary layers developed over different geometries is investigated through direct numerical simulation using an open-source DNS code. Spatial discretization is carried out using a high-order finite difference scheme coupled with the Immersed Boundary Method (IBM) to impose the body inside a generated Cartesian grid. A mathematical tool, “Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD),” is utilized for the reduced order modeling of the coherent flow features identifying both spatial and temporal characteristics. Additionally, theoretical correlations are utilized to identify the nature of instability developing inside vortical flow structures. Simulations are carried out in a High-Performance Computing (HPC) system based on CentOS 7 operating system.

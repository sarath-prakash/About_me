excerpt: High-order Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) are performed to examine the effect of ogive nose radius on hypersonic boundary layer transition. Three-dimensional stability characteristics are extracted using linear simulations imposed with wavepacket perturbations—using an implicitly linearized Navier–Stokes (NS-MFP) approach.

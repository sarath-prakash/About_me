excerpt: Investigation of transition characteristics of flight-relevant forebody geometries through high-fidelity numerical simulations. Designed numerical experiments using the computational tools to evaluate the impact of nose–body geometry on boundary layer transition for real-world aerospace applications. Numerical investigation of modulation of turbulent boundary layer structure by texture elements and assessed their impact on total drag.
